In a nutshell, Google Analytics is a free service for website analytics that helps website owners or admins view data related to their website traffic and activity.
Use Google Analytics to sort and sift website analytics into dozens of different data dimensions and metrics, such as:

* Which pages they visit on your website
* How long they viewed the page
* The browser they’re using
* If they’re on a desktop or mobile device
* What site they were on when they clicked over to yours
* Which forms the user-submitted
* How many users are currently on your site


## Features of Google Analytics

### 1. Traffic Reporting
These Google Analytics features are all about measuring the traffic and their flow on your site. This includes session durations, measuring bounce rates, and measuring new visitors and people who visit your site often; it also has the ability to show how your visitors come to the site and what phones or internet connections they use to access it.

### 2. Conversion Tracking
This is all about tracking conversions to the site. For example, for an e-commerce site, you can create a funnel to measure how many users abandon the cart or how many users added an item into their shopping cart.

### 3. Keyword Reporting
Alongside telling you which phone or OS your visitors used to come to your site, you can also see which keyword was used by visitors to find you. This can be used to create content on your site for SEO and more traffic to your site.

### 4. Third-Party Referrals
A digital marketer must understand where traffic to his site comes from. It has a source section that can show a source of traffic. The sources can be a particular website, Search Engine, or Social Media site.

### 5. Audience Information
It can also give you information about your audience; in the settings, you can enable options to measure the age, gender, and other details about your audience. Of course, it tracks the language, country, etc., data of visitors by default too.

### 6. Add ones for Google Analytics
No Analytics tool in the world can do everything; to deal with this, Google Analytics supports Add ons. These plugins can be used to extend the feature set of Google Analytics and make it possible to customize and modify the experience for the needs. It’s not that tough to install add-ons, too; there is a web-based system so that you don’t have to download and upload anything at all.
